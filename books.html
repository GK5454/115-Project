        <h2>A Song of Ice and Fire</h2>
        
        <p>Written by George R.R. Martin, A Song of Ice and Fire is a fantasy series with the first of (currently) six books published in 1996. It was made into a television show titled 'Game of Thrones' that would become one of the most watched series of all time.</p>
    
        <h3>Why It’s My Favorite</h3>
        <p>Although I didn't start reading this series until after watching the first season of GOT, Once I picked it up, I had a hard time putting it down. Since then I've read through the first five books three additional times each while simutaneously enjoying the TV series.</p>

        <h2>The Vampire Chronicles</h2>
        
        <p>By Author Anne Rice, a gothic vampire series that published its first book 'Interview with the Vampire' in 1976 and has since spawned a dozen more novels, two feature films, and recently a television series.</p>
    
        <h3>Why It’s My Favorite</h3>
        <p>Being the first novels I would read as a youth outside of school, the Vampire Lestat has been a companion nearly my entire life. And although I may have my own personal criticisms with the movies, I continue to enjoy the new content inspired by the late Anne Rice.</p>
